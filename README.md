## 1st Semester

This folder contains the activities developed during the **Algorithms and Programming** course, taught by [Professor Douglas A. Moreno](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3312128594028941).

### Topics Covered

- **Python Fundamentals**  
  Introduction to syntax, variables, data types, and basic operations.

- **Programming Logic**  
  Problem-solving techniques using flowcharts, pseudocode, and logical reasoning.

- **Control Structures**  
  Usage of conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`) and loop (`while`).

- **Basic Input and Output**  
  Handling user input and displaying results with `input()` and `print()`.

- **Simple Algorithms**  
  Writing clear and structured solutions for elementary problems.

> All exercises and materials reflect what was taught during the first semester of the Computer Science course at ULBRA Palmas.
